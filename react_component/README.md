Learning objectives

- When to use a Class or a function to create a component
- The lifecycle of a Class component

- How to optimize performance and control which components to render

Requirements

- Node 20.x.x and npm 10.x.x
- Install Jest globally if desired: `npm install -g jest`
- Each task folder contains its own dashboard app

Project structure

```
react_component/
  task_0/
    dashboard/
      src/
      package.json
      ...
```

Getting started (task_0)

cd react_component/task_0/dashboard
npm ci
npm test
npm run dev

Notes

- Linting and tests should pass with no warnings
